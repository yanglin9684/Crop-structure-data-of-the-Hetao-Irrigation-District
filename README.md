# Crop-structure-data-of-the-Hetao-Irrigation-District
This dataset employs a deep learning algorithm based on multilayer perceptrons, integrating vegetation features, texture features, spectral features, and crop phenological features to identify and extract crop types and land use patterns in the Hetao Irrigation District. After accuracy validation, the overall recognition accuracy reached 89% in 2021 with a Kappa coefficient of 0.87, demonstrating high extraction precision. Through model generalization techniques, the crop structure and land use in the Hetao Irrigation District from 2000 to 2021 were identified and extracted for analysis. The final product is a dataset of crop structure and land use for the Hetao Irrigation District from 2000 to 2021, featuring a spatial resolution of 30 meters.
